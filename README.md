## Creative Tilt
The goal of this game was to make a mash of endless runner games like Flappy Bird and the concept of gachapon. Gachapon is a Japanese vending machine where you put in some money and you get a random toy from a set. 

I had to look beyond class examples to figure out how to loop through filesystems in JavaScript. Unfortunately I was not able to find a solution without implementing Node.js which I did not have time to learn in time to turn it in.

I think that my game has great visual style. I worked with a friend of mine (Connor Bui) to help me draw the artwork. He gave me tips on what works in art and what doesn't and I would say I am very proud of what him and I came up with.

Not figuring out the filesystem threw a massive wrench in my plans to do something interesting with the endless runner form. At this current point it simply is a Flappy Bird clone that is reskinned. I plan on figuring out a different way of implementing the gacha aspect of this game as I think it would be really cool.
